# Chesspresso
Enhancement version of the original library by Bernhard Seybold (see www.chesspresso.org).

In 2016 I downloaded the unmodified code from https://github.com/desht/chesspresso. 
Since then I have used it extensively in some projects (still private, but not for long).
During these years I have made lots of changes: bugs were resolved, some parts
were newly written and many extensions were introduced. The present version is NOT 
downwards compatible, but it should be easy to replace the original code by this fork.

See also: https://github.com/jtsay362/chesspresso, for a separate fork of Chesspresso.
